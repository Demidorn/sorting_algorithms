0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Please, note this format is used for Quiz and Task questions.

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n square -> O(n^2)
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
n + k -> O(n+k)
…
Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.

TASKS

0. Bubble sort

	Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
